# CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) project (computer vision) - convolutional neural networks applications and techniques

Table of contents:

- Convolutional Neural Networks: Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying MNIST data, a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the CIFAR10 dataset.

- Transfer Learning. In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use pre-trained networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.

- Weight Initialization: Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.

- Autoencoders: Build models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.

- Style Transfer: Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!
